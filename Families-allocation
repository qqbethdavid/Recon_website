I made a script in dbeaver Recon Families script. I used this for the families. Start first with the nonfishes 
before going on with the fishes as these do not have much distribution. 

Look for the script ----PROCESSING----
you start there. You have a list of what families are already done. It is in 
C:\Ate\Work\Allocation\Families\temp_tables_from_dbeaver
