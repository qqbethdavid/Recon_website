Description of what the recon website is 

Remember that Martin works on the catches, Miel works on the taxon extents. 

allocation tables go to v_fact tables to integrate them altogether. 

allocation is like putting the catches into marine layers

Simple area cell assignment is used in the allocation. 

In the recon website, you will only check the distribution tab to check for 
how the extents look. 

You can search using taxon key, common name or scientific name
